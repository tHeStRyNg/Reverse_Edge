## Introduction

This document defines the scope, milestones, budget, and success criteria for the development of an Expert Advisor (EA) that operates in a normal mode (without trade copier integration). The EA is designed with a focus on robust testing, performance, and risk management. The project leverages the Follow-the-Sun (FTS) methodology to ensure continuous development and faster delivery by global teams.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:**  
  Develop an EA with solid trading logic, risk management, and predictable loss control. The system will be thoroughly tested under real-market conditions in a normal mode environment.

- **Approach:**  
  - Use the Follow-the-Sun (FTS) methodology for round-the-clock development and rapid feedback cycles.
  - Replace trade copier integration with rigorous testing of the EA’s designed functions.
  - Implement measurable success criteria for "loss generation" to ensure the EA meets its design goals.

- **Total Budget:**  
  **$1,000** (distributed proportionally across project milestones)

- **Estimated Total Duration:**  
  **3.5–4.5 weeks (FTS-enabled)**

## Architectural & Strategic Goals

- **Modularity:**  
  Break the EA into independent modules (configuration, market data processing, trading logic, risk management, order execution, logging/monitoring, and testing) for streamlined development and testing.

- **Reliability & Efficiency:**  
  Ensure that the EA performs consistently under live and simulated market conditions while maintaining efficient risk management and predictable performance.

- **Predictable Loss Generation:**  
  The EA is designed to lose consistently per predefined rules. This project includes detailed criteria to measure and adjust the EA’s performance, ensuring that accidental profits are logged and mitigated.

## Success Criteria for Loss Generation

To track the EA’s effectiveness in generating predictable losses, the following criteria and mechanisms will be implemented:

1. **Defining “Successful Loss Generation” Criteria:**
   - **Loss Consistency Target:**  
     The EA should lose **80%+ of trades** over time to meet the designed loss objectives.
   - **Stop-Loss Execution Rate:**  
     The majority of trades should close via stop-loss (SL) execution rather than reaching the take-profit (TP) levels.
   - **Accidental Win Tracking:**  
     Any trades that unexpectedly close in profit will be logged for future analysis. This data will help refine the trading logic to reduce accidental wins.

2. **Tracking & Mitigating Accidental Wins:**
   - **Logging Unexpected Wins:**  
     Implement detailed logging of any unexpected profitable trades. This will allow for post-analysis to understand under what market conditions these wins occur.
   - **Early Exit System Consideration:**  
     Evaluate and potentially implement an early exit strategy for profitable trades to maintain the overall target of consistent losses.

*Note:* These refinements are aimed at ensuring that the EA’s performance remains predictable and efficient. They are incorporated into the testing and performance monitoring phases and may be refined further in later iterations.

## Project Milestones & Budget Allocation

The project is divided into four key milestones, each with defined deliverables, timeframes, and budget allocation:

| **Milestone**                             | **Purpose**                                                                                                                                   | **Deliverables**                                                                                           | **Timeframe (With FTS)** | **% of Payment** | **Allocation from $1,000** |
