## 1. Introduction

This document details the architecture plan for the Expert Advisor (EA) system. The design focuses on modularity, clarity, and scalability, ensuring that each component can be developed, tested, and maintained independently. The architecture is built to support both live trading and thorough testing (normal mode), and it is designed to align with the Follow-the-Sun (FTS) methodology for continuous development.

---

## 2. Project Overview

- **Objective:**  
  Develop an EA with robust trading logic, risk management, and predictable loss control that can be thoroughly tested in a simulated environment.

- **Scope:**  
  Create an EA thatâ€™s designed to lose money in a structured, predictable way. The goal is to use a trade copier to reverse its trades and turn the losses into profit.  
  The EA will operate in a normal mode environment (without trade copier integration) and will be continuously improved using a global development approach.

---

## 3. Architectural Goals

- **Modularity:**  
  Decompose the system into independent modules to simplify development, testing, and maintenance.

- **Scalability:**  
  Ensure the system can accommodate additional functionalities and modifications without major redesign.

- **Reliability:**  
  Build a robust system with comprehensive error handling and logging to monitor live performance.

- **Efficiency:**  
  Enable rapid iterations and testing using the Follow-the-Sun methodology for a continuous development cycle.

---

## 4. Modular Architecture Overview

The architecture is organized around distinct modules responsible for various aspects of EA functionality. Clear interfaces are established between modules to enable parallel development and easy integration. This design facilitates both rapid prototyping and rigorous testing.

  - **Execution Verifier:** Confirms order execution and handles discrepancies.

- **Benefits:**
  - Decouples trading logic from execution mechanics.
  - Allows seamless switching between demo and live environments.

---

### 5.6. Logging, Monitoring & Error Handling Module

- **Purpose:**  
  Record events, errors, and transactions; provide real-time monitoring and alerts.

- **Components:**
  - **Event Logger:** Logs trades, system events, and errors.
  - **Alert System:** Provides real-time notifications of critical issues.

- **Benefits:**
  - Supports post-run analysis and debugging.
  - Enables proactive issue resolution through continuous monitoring.

---

### 5.7. Testing & Simulation Module

- **Purpose:**  
  Facilitate thorough testing of the EA using backtesting and live-simulation (normal mode).

- **Components:**
  - **Simulation Engine:** Mimics live market conditions using historical or live data.
  - **Test Runner:** Automates the execution of various test scenarios.
  - **Result Analyzer:** Processes test outcomes and performance metrics.

- **Benefits:**
  - Streamlines the verification of EA functionality.
  - Accelerates the feedback loop for rapid improvement.

## 6. Integration and Data Flow

1. **Initialization Phase:**
   - The EA boots up and loads configuration settings via the Input & Configuration Module.
   - All modules initialize and establish required connections (e.g., market data sources).

2. **Operational Phase:**
   - **Data Flow:**
     - Market data is ingested by the Market Data & Signal Processing Module.
     - Processed signals are passed to the Trading Logic & Strategy Engine.
   - **Risk & Execution:**
     - Prior to order execution, the Risk Management Module evaluates the risk associated with each trade.
     - Orders are submitted via the Order Execution Module.
   - **Logging & Monitoring:**
     - All events, transactions, and errors are logged for analysis.
     - Continuous monitoring ensures system reliability.

3. **Testing Phase (Normal Mode):**
   - The Testing & Simulation Module executes tests using simulated market conditions.
   - Results feed back into the system for iterative refinements.

4. **Feedback Loop:**
   - Continuous feedback from logs, testing, and monitoring supports rapid iterative improvements, following the FTS methodology.

---

## 7. Deployment Considerations

- **Modular Packaging:**
  - Modules can be deployed individually or combined into a single executable EA depending on platform requirements (e.g., MetaTrader).

- **Configuration Management:**
  - Centralized configuration settings allow quick adjustments without redeploying code.

- **Scalability:**
  - The architecture is designed to accommodate future enhancements such as additional strategies or advanced analytics.

---

## 8. Follow-the-Sun (FTS) Methodology Integration

- **Global Development Teams:**
  - Teams in different time zones work sequentially to ensure 24/7 progress.
