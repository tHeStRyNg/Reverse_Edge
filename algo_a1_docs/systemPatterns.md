# System Patterns

## Architectural Overview
The EA system is designed with a modular architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and independent development of each component. The architecture is organized around distinct modules responsible for various aspects of EA functionality.

## Core Modules
1. **Input & Configuration Module**
   - Manages user-defined settings and parameters.
   - Components: Parameter Loader, Validation Engine.

2. **Market Data & Signal Processing Module**
   - Collects, preprocesses, and analyzes market data.
   - Components: Data Feed Handler, Indicator Engine, Signal Generator.

3. **Trading Logic & Strategy Engine**
   - Implements the core trading strategies.
   - Components: Strategy Manager, Rule Engine.

4. **Risk Management Module**
   - Monitors and controls risk to ensure trades adhere to predefined risk parameters.
   - Components: Position Sizing Engine, Risk Evaluator.

5. **Order Execution Module**
   - Handles order placement, modification, and cancellation.
   - Components: Order Manager, Execution Verifier.

6. **Logging, Monitoring & Error Handling Module**
   - Records events, errors, and transactions.
   - Components: Event Logger, Alert System.

7. **Testing & Simulation Module**
   - Facilitates thorough testing of the EA.
   - Components: Simulation Engine, Test Runner, Result Analyzer.

## Data Flow
1. **Initialization Phase**
   - The EA boots up and loads configuration settings.
   - All modules initialize and establish required connections.

2. **Operational Phase**
   - Market data is ingested and processed to generate trading signals.
   - Risk management evaluates each trade before order execution.
   - All events, transactions, and errors are logged for analysis.

3. **Testing Phase**
   - The EA is tested using simulated market conditions.
   - Results feed back into the system for iterative refinements.

## Deployment Considerations
- Modules can be deployed individually or combined into a single executable EA.
- Centralized configuration settings allow quick adjustments without redeploying code.
- The architecture is designed to accommodate future enhancements.
